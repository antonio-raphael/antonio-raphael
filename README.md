# Hi there! I'm Antonio

I am currently a Masters students in the Data and Economics for Public Policy program at École Polytechnique. As well as a Research Assistant at the Centre de recherche en économie et statistique (CREST) working to clean education and family data for a study on the effect of perceptions of peer effort on educational outcomes using Norwegian education and family data.

Prior to that, I was a research programmer conducting data-based program evaluation at Social Policy Research Associates, and even before that, I completed my bachelors at the Univerisity of California, Los Angeles where I studied economics, focusing on econometrics.

I apply data science techniques, machine learning, and causal inference methods to answer policy and research questions. I build reproducible workflows in **R** and **Python**, with strong interests in **econometrics**, **machine learning**, and **causal inference**. My interest and research areas are Labor Economics, Public Health, Workforce Development, Crime and Criminal Justice, Education, and National Defense.

## Featured Project

### Walkenhorst-Scraping  
Web scraping + data analysis on pricing disparities  
https://github.com/antonio-raphael/Walkenhorst-Scraping  

This project was completed as part of a Telecom-Paris course. It combines PDF and web scraping (Python & R), data cleaning, fuzzy matching, and statistical analysis to quantify pricing differences between inmate commissary prices and retail prices using regression modeling. It demonstrates real-world scraping, reproducible data pipelines, and applied econometric testing to demonstrate the monopoly power of a firm in a captive market.
